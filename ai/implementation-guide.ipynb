    "The primary \"trained model\" in this Spotify music recommendation code is the **`song_cluster_pipeline`**, a scikit-learn `Pipeline` object consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `StandardScaler` (fitted on the numeric audio features).\n",
    "- A `KMeans` model (with 20 clusters, trained on the scaled song data).\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline handles the scaling and is used in the `recommend_songs()` function to transform the mean vector of input songs and the full dataset for computing cosine distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export (save) this trained pipeline for later use (e.g., in a production app or another script), use **`joblib`** (recommended by scikit-learn for models with large NumPy arrays, as it's more efficient than pickle).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import joblib (if not already imported)\n",
    "Add this at the top with your other imports:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import joblib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Save the trained pipeline after fitting\n",
    "Add this code right after the block where `song_cluster_pipeline` is fitted:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save the trained song clustering pipeline\n",
    "joblib.dump(song_cluster_pipeline, 'spotify_song_cluster_pipeline.joblib')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a file named `spotify_song_cluster_pipeline.joblib` in your current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: (Optional) Save the dataset for metadata\n",
    "The recommendations pull song names, years, and artists from the `data` DataFrame. To make the recommender fully portable, save the dataset too:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data.to_pickle('spotify_data.pkl')  # Or use joblib: joblib.dump(data, 'spotify_data.joblib')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Load and Reuse the Model Later\n",
    "In a new script or app:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import joblib\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the pipeline and data\n",
    "song_cluster_pipeline = joblib.load('spotify_song_cluster_pipeline.joblib')\n",
    "data = pd.read_pickle('spotify_data.pkl')  # Or joblib.load()\n",
    "\n",
    "number_cols = ['valence', 'year', 'acousticness', 'danceability', 'duration_ms', 'energy', 'explicit',\n",
    "               'instrumentalness', 'key', 'liveness', 'loudness', 'mode', 'popularity', 'speechiness', 'tempo']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reuse the same functions (get_mean_vector, recommend_songs, etc.)\n",
    "# ... paste or import the function definitions ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example recommendation\n",
    "recommend_songs([{'name': 'Come As You Are', 'year': 1991}, ...], data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- **Why joblib?** It's faster and uses less disk space for scikit-learn objects compared to Python's built-in `pickle`.\n",
    "- Alternative with pickle:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pickle\n",
    "  with open('spotify_song_cluster_pipeline.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n",
    "      pickle.dump(song_cluster_pipeline, f)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- The genre clustering pipeline or PCA/t-SNE pipelines are only for visualization and not needed for recommendations.\n",
    "- If deploying (e.g., Flask app), load the model once at startup for efficiency.\n",
    "- The Spotipy part (for fetching missing songs) remains separate and requires Spotify API credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to reuse the exact trained scaling + clustering without retraining on the large dataset."
